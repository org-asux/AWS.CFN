  VPC:
    VPCID: existing
          ### This means NO vpc.yaml will be created.  This if for 'developers' who don't care, or want freedom to work within their own world (a.ka. their own VPC)
          ### Code will search for VPCs in the following sequence :-
          ###   (1) Match Tag/Name for MyOrgName/MyDomainName .. _IF_ provided above
          ###   (2) Tag/Name: VPC-by-ASUX.org-${ASUX::JobSetName}
          ###   (3) Tag/CreatedBy: matches that of the AWSProfile used for SDK calls.
          ###   (4) There is only one NON-Default-VPC (that this AWSProfile has access to, in this region)_
          ###   (5) There is only one VPC that is also a DEFAULT-VPC

    SG:
      SG-type: ssh  ### REQUIREMENT: If VPC-ID and __EVEN__ 1-single Subnet-ID is specified, then SG-for-SSH _CANNOT_ be created.
                    ###     Use the 'SG-type' to search for existing-SecurityGroups, for an SG that has a Tag/Name: APPLNAME .. whose Value: startsWith(SG-type)
                    ### Multiple SG-type?  Simply add another entry of 'SG-type'!

    subnet:
      SubnetID: existing public ### Attention: there are 2 words in the LHS!
                ### This means NO subnet.yaml will be created.  This if for 'developers' who don't care, or want freedom to work within their own world (a.ka. their own VPC)
                ### Code will search for SUBNETS in the following sequence :-
                ###   (1) Match Tag/Name for MyOrgName/MyDomainName .. _IF_ provided @ Top of this YAML comfiguration
                ###   (2) Tag/Name: Tag_Name=Subnet-${ASUX::PublicOrPrivate}${ASUX::foreach.index+1}${ASUX::ItemNumber}-${ASUX::MyVPCStackPrefix}-${ASUX::JobSetName}
                ###   (3) Tag/CreatedBy: matches that of the AWSProfile used for SDK calls.
                ###   (4) There is only one ${ASUX::PublicOrPrivate} subnet (associated with above VPC).
                ###   Note: Since subnets created by OTHER-SOFTWARE will NOT tell me if the subnet is private or public.. this is it!
