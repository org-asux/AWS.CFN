### !!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
### This is about creating NEW servers - when Enterprise-IT has already created the VPCs, Subnets and SGs.
###   To prep/simulate the 'environment':-
### Step 1: /Users/Sarma/Documents/Development/src/org.ASUX/AWS/CFN/myjobs/2layer/stackset.sh (or clone/edit it - to remove the EC2-create)
### Step 2: Delete the EC2 instances - if created
### Step 3: Go to the AWS-Console and jot down the VPC-ID, SG-ID, Subnet-IDs
### !!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AWS:
  AWSRegion: ohio ### tokyo #___ ap-northeast-1
  ### If the following 3 KV-Pairs are NOT provided, then .. 1st check if VPCID is provided (below).  If provided, then.. check the Tags of VPCID, for these 3 KV-pairs.
  #___ MyOrgName: org-ASUX                 ### assuming ASUX.org tools were used to create the VPC (the VPC that is specified below as 'existing')
  #___ MyEnvironment: Playground           ### assuming ASUX.org tools were used to create the VPC (the VPC that is specified below as 'existing')
  #___ MyDomainName: playground.asux.org   ### assuming ASUX.org tools were used to create the VPC (the VPC that is specified below as 'existing')

  VPC:
    VPCID: vpc-0f99bc8bd45b7b074    ### This means NO vpc.yaml will be created.

    SG:
      SG-type: ssh
      SG-ID: sg-059720e48dfe892ca  ### REQUIREMENT: If VPC-ID and __EVEN__ 1-single Subnet-ID is specified, then SG-for-SSH must be specified.
