### Note: NOT _MANDATORY_ to implement this ACL-Entry for VPN-Client, as the default ASUX.org's NACL-rules for _PUBLIC_ subnets allow ALL traffic > 1024 port #
### Note: This rule is automatic - per the _DEFAULT_ PUBLIC NACL rule-set - as generated by ASUX.org tools

  InboundVPNUDPNetworkAclEntryFor${ASUX::WhichNACLRef}:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::NetworkAclEntry'
    Properties:
      NetworkAclId: !Ref ${ASUX::WhichNACLRef}  ### !Ref MyDefaultNetworkAcl
      RuleNumber: '${ASUX::NACLRuleNumber}'     ### '100'
      Protocol: 17 ### Specify 17 for UDP .... and 6 for TCP
      RuleAction: allow
      Egress: 'false'   ### Whether this rule applies to egress traffic from the subnet (true) or ingress traffic to the subnet (false). By default, AWS CloudFormation specifies false
      CidrBlock: ${ASUX::VPN-CLIENT-CIDRRange}  ### Usually, this CIDR-range is a _SUBSET_ of IPs - WITHIN a _PUBLIC_ subnet's CIDR-Range.
      PortRange:
        From: '1194'
        To: '1194'    ### 1194 is the OpenVPN UDP port (industry standard)
